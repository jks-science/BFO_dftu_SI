[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/85782594.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/85782594)

[VASP](https://www.vasp.at/) and [pymatgen](http://pymatgen.org/) were used to study the effects of the U parameter on the structural and electronic properties of BFO. 
Here we present the input and output files necessary to reproduce the results, together with some of the analysis, contained in a Jupyter notebook.
